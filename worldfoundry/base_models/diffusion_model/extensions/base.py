"""Composable research extensions for the canonical diffusion loop.

The runner owns the sampling loop in :mod:`..contracts` types.  An extension
is a per-instance hook object: it must return the same contract types it
receives (``Conditioning``, ``DenoiserInput``, ``DenoiserOutput``, or a latent
tensor).  A wrong return type is a :exc:`TypeError` at the runner, not here.

Hooks are no-ops by default so a recipe can install a mix of research
extensions without every class implementing every seam.
