"""Post-load merged-QKV build transform for separate-projection attention.

Wan's ``SelfAttention`` projects Q/K/V with three independent
``nn.Linear(dim, dim)`` layers (``self.q``/``self.k``/``self.v``) and applies
QK-norm + RoPE *after* projection. Because the norms and RoPE act on the split
outputs, the three projections can be fused into one ``nn.Linear(dim, 3*dim)``
followed by a split — this is bitwise-equivalent up to GEMM reduction order and
removes two kernel launches (and two weight reads) per attention block.

This is a load-time transform (run after the dense checkpoint is loaded, before
offload hooks), matching the FastVideo/LightX2V "replace at load, not per
request" pattern. It duck-types the target so it does not import the Wan class,
and it is a no-op on already-fused modules (a single ``qkv`` Linear, as in
Sana). Cross-attention is intentionally skipped: its Q and K/V consume different
inputs and cannot share one projection.
