"""Causal Ulysses attention: sequence-sharded QKV plus the in-tree causal kernel.

Ulysses all-to-alls heads into full-sequence shards, then runs
local attention. This wrapper pins that local kernel to
:func:`~worldfoundry.core.attention.varlen.flash_attention` so causal video
(LingBot) keeps one mask/window contract. Generic (possibly non-causal)
Ulysses lives in :mod:`worldfoundry.core.attention.ulysses_attention`.
