"""Which interactive world models are eligible for the 60-second memory track.

A memory_loop sample is one still image plus a camera itinerary that is closed by
construction, rolled out for 60 seconds. Only interactive world models qualify: the
adapter has to consume a per-token camera path and grow a short default clip into a
minute-long rollout without breaking that closure.

This module is the single declarative source for the roster. It records the
generation overrides each model needs to reach 60 seconds, and it records why the
remaining camera-capable models are excluded, so a skipped model is an auditable
decision rather than a silent omission.
