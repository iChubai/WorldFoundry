"""MiniMax H3 audio-video adapter for WorldArena.

MiniMax H3 was ported into the sibling **WorldFoundry** project as
``worldfoundry.pipelines.minimax.pipeline_minimax_h3.NativeMiniMaxH3Pipeline``.
WorldArena drives it out of process (like the other heavy video models) so the
bespoke DiT / video VAE / audio VAE / Qwen3-VL encoder load once per benchmark
shard.  The subprocess must run under an interpreter that can import *both*
``worldarena`` (for the batch-runner helpers) and ``worldfoundry`` (for the
pipeline); point ``python_bin`` at that unified environment and ``repo_root`` at
the WorldFoundry checkout in the model YAML.
