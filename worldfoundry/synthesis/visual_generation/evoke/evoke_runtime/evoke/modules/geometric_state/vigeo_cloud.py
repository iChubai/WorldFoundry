"""ViGeo depth estimation -- a drop-in replacement for DA3DepthEstimator in the cloud-warp backend.

This matches DA3's *output contract*, not its method. DA3 is pose-conditioned -- the GT extrinsics and
intrinsics are network inputs, so its depth is solved inside the GT camera model -- while ViGeo accepts
images only, predicting its own poses and focal length with depth up-to-scale. The bridge is that DA3's
own alignment step effectively replaces intrinsics/extrinsics with the GT ones and uses the Umeyama scale
purely to rescale depth, so ViGeo can take the same route: rescale by the Umeyama scale between the GT
camera centres and ViGeo's predicted ones, then unproject with the GT K.

Because `FrameBank.ingest` only calls `depth_window`, the FrameBank, point cloud, renderers and every
hygiene / recall gate are reused untouched -- an A/B isolates the geometry model alone.

Two things do not transfer from DA3:

- **conf units.** ViGeo conf is raw logits (can be negative); DA3 conf is positive. `conf_transform="exp"`
  maps it positive and, being monotone, leaves percentile gates such as `conf_percentile` unaffected.
  Absolute thresholds (`hygiene_conf_abs`, `consist_conf_ref`, `self_reanchor_anchor_min_conf`) are
  calibrated in DA3 units; measured equivalents for DA3's 2.5 are ~0.17 (real footage) / ~0.084 (game).
- **focal length.** ViGeo self-estimates focal, so unprojecting with the GT K is a pinhole mismatch that
  varies per window -- the observed GT/ViGeo ratio spans ~0.78-1.13 over a rollout and crosses 1.0, so it
  is not a fixed bias. `EVOKE_VIGEO_DEBUG=1` logs it per window.

        Why these exist. `per_window` / `anchor` both solve `c = umeyama(GT centres, ViGeo centres)` and
        divide depth by it, which ties the cloud's size to *how much camera motion ViGeo reads out of the
        frames it was given*. Two trajectory families break that:

          * zero commanded translation (a pure pan/orbit-in-place): no baseline at all, `c_raw is None`,
            every window is skipped and the cloud stays empty -- the warp is black for the whole rollout.
          * a first chunk that barely moves: chunk 0 has no warp yet (nothing to reproject from), so its
            content is driven by image+text alone. If it comes out near-static, ViGeo correctly reports
            ~no camera motion, `c` collapses, depth is divided by ~1e-4, the cloud lands at infinity and
            the warp becomes a still image -- which the model then faithfully continues. Self-locking.

        Both disappear once the scale stops being a *ratio* -- i.e. unproject the depth map as-is and
        never derive a scale from camera centres. ViGeo's depth is up-to-scale (`_remap`:
        z = logits.clamp(-10,10).exp()), not metric like DA3's, so instead we fix the *one* free
        scalar directly:

          "depth_median"  c = median(depth) / depth_median_target, solved on the first window and locked.
                          After the division the cloud's median depth is `depth_median_target`, so the
                          commanded trajectory is read in units of scene depth: translating by 1.0 moves
                          the camera one median-scene-depth. This is the mode that makes a benchmark's
                          per-model translation knob (WorldScore's `camera_speed`) mean something --
                          under `anchor` it is algebraically a no-op, because scaling the commanded
                          motion by k scales `c` by k and the resolved depth by k, leaving parallax
                          unchanged.
          "fixed"         c = scale_value verbatim. For reproducing one specific run, or when the caller
                          already knows the conversion factor.

        Locked on the first window in both cases: one rollout shares one coordinate frame, so it needs
        exactly one scalar, and re-solving per window would reintroduce the drift `anchor` exists to avoid.
