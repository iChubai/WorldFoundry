"""jsonl-driven batched inference worker (one shard).

The three launchers share this driver. All knobs come in through environment variables;
for each case it shells out to
`scripts/inference/infer_single.py`:

  - scripts/inference/infer_stage1.sh       -> models/evoke/stage1_camera_control (multi-step, IS_STAGE2=0)
  - scripts/inference/infer_post_distill.sh -> models/evoke/stage3_post_distillation (3-step, long rollout)

Each launcher mirrors the knobs of its training config. A warp/attention mismatch between
training and inference degrades quality, so a new model means updating its launcher.
