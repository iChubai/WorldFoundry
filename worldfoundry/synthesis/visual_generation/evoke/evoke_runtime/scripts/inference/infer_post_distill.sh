# Post-distilled model -- batched inference; rolls out to minute scale
#   Weights : models/evoke/stage3_post_distillation
#   Engine  : scripts/inference/infer_batch.py -> scripts/inference/infer_single.py
#
#   What distillation bought, and what this script pins:
#     * 3 sampling steps  -- a 3-stage pyramid, one step per stage (STAGE2_STEPS="1 1 1")
#     * no CFG            -- guidance_scale 1.0, i.e. one forward per step, not two
#   Both are properties of the released weights, not tuning knobs. Raising the step count
#   does not improve this model; it was distilled to be sampled exactly this way.
#
#   Every knob below mirrors the training config "configs/training/stage3_post_distillation.yaml".
#   Inference and training MUST agree on the warp / attention recipe: a mismatch
#   silently degrades image quality, it is not just a speed difference.
#
#   MODE=v2v (default) | i2v | t2v | segment

#     t2v      prompt only                   -> NO camera control; warp is off (the CLI rejects warp+t2v)

  NOTE: trained on v2v conditioning only -> i2v / t2v / segment are ZERO-SHOT here.

Examples
  MODE=i2v MAX_CASES=1 NUM_FRAMES=721  bash scripts/inference/infer_post_distill.sh      # ~30s clip, no external data needed
  MODE=segment NUM_CHUNKS=6            bash scripts/inference/infer_post_distill.sh      # bundled 3-segment demo, no external data needed
  MODE=v2v LOCAL_GPUS=4                bash scripts/inference/infer_post_distill.sh      # full v2v eval over the sekai jsonl
  TRANSFORMER_PATH=<other-ckpt>        bash scripts/inference/infer_post_distill.sh      # same recipe, different checkpoint

Full sweep (needs the shared dataset mounted)
  MODE=v2v JSONL=<your-sweep>.jsonl MAX_CASES=0 \
    VROOT=<video-root> AROOT=<annotation-root> bash <this script>

Knobs   LOCAL_GPUS (shard by case)  MAX_CASES (0=all)
        NUM_CHUNKS  exact chunk count (1 chunk = 36 frames = 1.5s @24fps) -- prefer this
        NUM_FRAMES  picks the chunk count only, it does NOT bound the output:
                    chunks = ceil(NUM_FRAMES/33), frames = 36*chunks - 3
                    721 -> 22 chunks -> 789 frames (32.9s);  2877 -> 88 -> 3165 (131.9s)
        v2v only: REF_VIDEO_SEC (default 5) = how much of the reference video conditions the
                  model, i.e. generation continues from that point. Forced to 0 for i2v/t2v.
        START_SECONDS (default 0) offsets where that window is taken from; it also shifts the
                  pose track, so it applies to i2v too (NOT forced to 0).
        HEIGHT WIDTH FPS  GUIDANCE_SCALE  SEED  OUT_ROOT  JSONL  TRANSFORMER_PATH
        EVOKE_PYTHON_BIN  prepended to PATH, for picking the interpreter
Logs    LOCAL_GPUS=1 streams the run to the terminal and to logs/ (chunk-level progress bar
        included). QUIET=1 redirects it to the log only; multi-shard runs always redirect.
Long    Rollouts above ~5min must stream: STREAM_LONG=1 decodes per chunk and stitches the final
        mp4 from segments/ (the driver refuses to accumulate more than 7200 frames on GPU).
        GEO_HIST_MAX_FRAMES bounds the DA3 point cloud for hour-scale runs -- note it changes the
        warp input, so it is a recipe change, not just a memory knob. See the README.
Output  $OUT_ROOT/<case>/geo_pred.mp4                      generated video (always)
