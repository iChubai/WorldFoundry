"""Policy-driven KV cache for the vendored Causal-rCM runtime.

The upstream cache grows without bound: every committed chunk stays resident, so
a long rollout is limited by cache memory rather than by the model. This subclass
routes each committed chunk through a
:class:`~worldfoundry.core.attention.kv_cache_policy.KVCachePolicy`, which decides
what survives, without touching the sampler or the attention kernels.

**The invariant that makes this safe.** The upstream runtime addresses the cache
by *global block cursor*: ``block_range`` is the index of the chunk being
generated, and the plain cache satisfies ``block_range == len(_cum_ends)`` because
it never drops anything. Eviction breaks that identity — the cursor keeps
advancing while the retained chunk count does not. This class therefore keeps the
two quantities separate:

* :attr:`committed_blocks` counts chunks ever appended, so the caller's cursor
  still matches and the runtime's ``APPEND`` assertion holds.
* :meth:`get` and :meth:`get_prefix_end` clamp a cursor-valued ``block_range`` to
  what is actually retained.

The clamp is exact rather than defensive: every policy here evicts only whole
chunks that strictly precede the current one, so "the first ``block_range``
chunks" and "everything retained" denote the same tokens once eviction has
happened. A policy that dropped part of the *current* chunk would violate that,
which is why :meth:`append` verifies it.
